    title: "What makes fiber broadband better than regular internet?",
    content:
      "Fiber broadband transmits data as light through glass cables - not electricity through copper. That means faster speeds, lower lag, and reliable performance even during busy hours. Perfect for streaming, gaming, and working - all at once."
  },
  {
    title: "How much internet speed do I really need?",
    content:
      "Most homes function smoothly with 100–300 Mbps, but if you stream in 4K, play online games, or use multiple smart devices, 500 Mbps or higher keeps everything running without delay. Skylink offers flexible plans to match your lifestyle, not just your browsing habits."
  },
  {
    title: "Will my connection slow down when everyone’s online?",
    content:
      "Nope. Skylink Fiber utilizes dedicated fiber lines that can handle heavy traffic without bottlenecks. So even when everyone’s streaming or calling, your connection stays steady."
  },
  {
    title: "How long does installation take?",
    content:
      "Once your address is fiber-ready, setup takes around 2–4 hours. Our technicians handle wiring, configuration, and testing - you’ll be online the same day."
  },
  {
    title: "Can I watch OTT apps and live TV without a set-top box?",

    title: "My Wi-Fi signal isn’t strong in every room. What should I do?",

  },

    title: "Does Skylink really offer unlimited data?",
    content:
      "Yes - and we mean it. Every Skylink plan includes true unlimited data with no caps, throttling, or conditions. Stream, download, and work freely without watching a meter."

    title: "Can I use my own router with Skylink?",
